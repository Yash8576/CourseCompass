Chemistry is the study of matter, its properties, and how substances interact and transform. It plays a fundamental role in scientific advancements, from drug development to energy production. Chemists investigate atomic structures, chemical reactions, and molecular compositions, contributing to fields such as medicine, engineering, and environmental science.

A Chemistry degree covers organic, inorganic, physical, and analytical chemistry, allowing students to explore chemical bonding, reaction mechanisms, and spectroscopy. Laboratory work is an essential component, where students conduct experiments to synthesize new compounds, analyze unknown substances, and test chemical reactions under controlled conditions. These hands-on experiences prepare students for careers in research, pharmaceuticals, and materials science.

Chemists are in high demand in industries such as healthcare, energy, and manufacturing. They work in pharmaceutical companies developing new medications, in forensic labs analyzing crime scene evidence, and in environmental agencies monitoring pollution levels. With the growing need for sustainable energy and green chemistry solutions, chemists are at the forefront of discovering eco-friendly materials and processes to reduce environmental impact.
