Psychology is the scientific study of human behavior and mental processes. It explores how people think, feel, and interact with others, aiming to understand emotions, cognitive functions, and psychological disorders. Psychologists apply research findings to help individuals improve their well-being, diagnose mental health conditions, and enhance workplace productivity.

A Psychology degree covers various branches, including clinical psychology, cognitive psychology, and social psychology. Students learn about brain function, memory, perception, and the impact of social influences on behavior. Psychological research plays a crucial role in areas such as mental health therapy, education, and human resources, helping to develop effective treatment methods and behavior modification techniques.

Career opportunities for psychology graduates include clinical psychologists, counselors, human resource specialists, and research analysts. They work in hospitals, schools, corporate organizations, and government agencies to address mental health challenges, improve learning strategies, and analyze consumer behavior. With increasing awareness of mental health issues, psychologists are more important than ever in promoting emotional well-being and behavioral insights.
